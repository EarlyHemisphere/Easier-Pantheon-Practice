# Better P5 Practice

## Description:
A mod that allows for Pantheon practice in HoG. It changes the health and damage to match with pantheons while also giving the ability to do fury practice or add soul, lifeblood before each fight starts. Additionally, it adds hotkeys to: 1) quickly reload bosses 2) quickly return to HoG 3) Move around HoG.

## Why Would I use this?:
- The remove health and add lifeblood can be used for practicing Fighting with **Fury of the Fallen**.
- The hotkeys can be used to lower redundant waiting time (read below)
- It can be used to practice specific bosses in P5 such as **Collector**. (also compatible with bindings mod for AB practice)
- The hitless option allows practice for hitless P5. Why use this over radiant? Because the health in radiant doesn't match the health in P5 (but it does with this mod). 

## HotKeys Explanation
- Key_Reload_Boss -> Press this key during a boss fight to quickly reload the boss. Probs should be done just as the boss dies. Note that after pressing the reload key and killing the boss, you won't be able to return normally. you will need to press the "Key_return_to_hog" or dremgate
- Key_return_to_hog -> Equivalent to dream gating but much faster and doesn't burn your eyes by flashing a white screen
- Key_teleport_around_HoG -> Teleports you one by one to the 4 corners of HoG.

## Examples of Using the Extra Features
- The remove health can be set to max health - 1 (so 8) to trigger fury of the fallen as soon as the fight starts to help practice with fury (the add lifeblood can be used to make it more easier to practice).
- The add lifeblood can be used to give more leniency and make practicing easier.
- Add soul can be used to start the fight off with soul to simulate a real fight in pantheons.
- The hitless option allows you to get insta killed to practice hitless bosses.

## How to Use:
- Download the mod and open any existing save file. If you want to use it with a new save file, make one and then reload it.
- To use the hotkeys/other settings, open the save file location and edit the values in EasierAscended.GlobalSettings.json. This generates after loading the game with the mod installed. To bind a key, add a number or lower case letter between the "" like `Key_Reload_Boss = "b"`.

## Other:
- The mod only works in Hall of Gods and doesn't affect pantheons or other areas of the game.
- The mod affects bosses of health. Needless to say, it shouldn't be used with other modded boss. If you do want to, turn this mod off in the game settings.
- Please dont reload bosses when a boss scream is happening. Just don't please. If you do you'll need to leave and renter the room.
- Soul should be added in multiples of 33 or 24 (if using soul twister) to be able to use any spells. 
- If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, you can message me on discord at Mulhima#2695.

## Dependancies:
- This mod depends on SFCore and the Modding API (Obviously)
