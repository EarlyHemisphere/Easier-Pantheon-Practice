# Easier_Ascended

## Description:
A mod that allows you to practice for P5 in HoG. This mod changes the health and damage of ascended bosses to match with P5. It also adds the option to remove health, add soul,  add lifeblood before each fight starts.
  
## Uses:
- It can be used to practice specific bosses in P5 such as markoth.
- The remove health and add lifeblood can be used for practice for fury strats.

## Dependancies:
- The only dependancy is Mod Common and the Modding API (obviously).

## How to Use:
- To remove health, add lifeblood or add soul before each fight, open the saves file location and edit the values in EasierAscended.GlobalSettings.json
- **Note**: Soul should be added in multiples of 33 or 24 (if using soul twister) if you want any use from it.
- Download the mod and open an existing normal/godhome save file. 
- If you want to use it with a new save file, make one and then reload it.

## Other:
- With this mod, most **Attuned Bosses** in HoG deal 0 damage. If you want to practice in attuned, turn off this mod in the game settings.
- The mod affects bosses of health. Needless to say, it shouldn't be used with other modded boss. If you do want to, turn this mod off in the game settings.
