# Easier_Ascended

## Description:
A mod that allows practice for P5 in HoG. This mod changes the health and damage of ascended bosses to match with P5 and adds the ability to remove health (for fury practice) and add soul or lifeblood before each fight starts. Also add an option for hitless practice.
  
## Why Would I use this?:
- It can be used to practice specific bosses in P5 such as **Markoth**.
- The remove health and add lifeblood features can be used for practicing **Fury Strats**.
- It is compatible with Toggleable bindings which allows practice for P5 AB bosses such as **AB Collector**.
- The hitless option allows practice for hitless P5. Why use this over radiant? Because the health in radiant doesn't match the health in P5 (but it does with this mod). 

## Examples of Using the Extra Features
- The remove health can be set to a low value like 2-3 to simulate a real fight in P5.
- The remove health can be set to max health - 1 (so 8) to trigger fury of the fallen as soon as the fight starts to help practice with fury (the add lifeblood can be used to make it more easier to practice).
- The add lifeblood can be used to give more leniency and make practicing easier.
- Add soul can be used to start the fight off with soul to simulate a real fight in p5.
- The hitless option allows you to get insta killed to practice hitless bosses. 

## How to Use:
- Download the mod and open any existing save file. If you want to use it with a new save file, make one and then reload it.
- To remove health, add lifeblood or add soul before each fight, open the save file location and edit the values in EasierAscended.GlobalSettings.json. **Note**: Soul should be added in multiples of 33 or 24 (if using soul twister) to be able to use any spells.

## Other:
- The mod only works in Hall of Gods and doesn't affect pantheons or other areas of the game.
- With this mod, the double damage **Attuned Bosses** in HoG won't work properly. If you want to practice in attuned, turn off this mod in the game settings.
- The mod affects bosses of health. Needless to say, it shouldn't be used with other modded boss. If you do want to, turn this mod off in the game settings.
- If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, you can message me on discord at Mulhima#2695.

## Dependancies:
- The only dependancy is Mod Common and the Modding API (obviously).

## Credits
- Thank you to everyone in #modding-development for helping me make this mod and also for having open source code for me to read. This mod was heavily influcenced by the mods Pale Prince by fifty-six, Mantis Gods by fifty-six and Buzzbo by thegodfriend.
