# Easier_Ascended

## Description:
A mod that allows you to practice for P5 in HoG. This mod changes the health and damage of ascended bosses to match with P5. It also adds the option to remove health, add soul,  add lifeblood before each fight starts.
  
## Uses:
- It can be used to practice specific bosses in P5 such as markoth.
- The remove health and add lifeblood can be used for practice for fury strats.

## Dependancies:
- The only dependancy is Mod Common and the Modding API (obviously).

## How to Use:
- Download the mod and open any existing save file. If you want to use it with a new save file, make one and then reload it.
- The mod only works in Hall of Gods and doesnt affect pantheons.
- To remove health, add lifeblood or add soul before each fight, open the saves file location and edit the values in EasierAscended.GlobalSettings.json. **Note**: Soul should be added in multiples of 33 or 24 (if using soul twister) to be able to use any spells.


## Other:
- With this mod, most **Attuned Bosses** in HoG deal 0 damage. If you want to practice in attuned, turn off this mod in the game settings.
- The mod affects bosses of health. Needless to say, it shouldn't be used with other modded boss. If you do want to, turn this mod off in the game settings.

# Credits
- Thank you to everyone in #modding-development for helping me make this mod and also for having open source code for me to read. This mod was heavily influcenced by the mods Pale Prince by fifty-six, Mantis Gods by fifty-six and Buzzbo by thegodfriend.
