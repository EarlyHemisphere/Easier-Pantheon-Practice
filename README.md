# Easier_Ascended

## Description:
A mod that allows practice for P5 in HoG. This mod changes the health and damage of ascended bosses to match with P5. It also adds additional features such as giving the ability to remove health (for fury practice), add soul or add lifeblood before each fight starts.
  
## Uses:
- It can be used to practice specific bosses in P5 such as **Markoth**.
- The remove health and add lifeblood features can be used for practicing **Fury Strats**.
- It is compatible with Toggleable bindings which allows practice for P5 AB bosses such as **AB Collector**.

## Dependancies:
- The only dependancy is Mod Common and the Modding API (obviously).

## How to Use:
- Download the mod and open any existing save file. If you want to use it with a new save file, make one and then reload it.
- The mod only works in Hall of Gods and doesn't affect pantheons or other areas of the game.
- To remove health, add lifeblood or add soul before each fight, open the saves file location and edit the values in EasierAscended.GlobalSettings.json. **Note**: Soul should be added in multiples of 33 or 24 (if using soul twister) to be able to use any spells.

## Other:
- With this mod, the double damage **Attuned Bosses** in HoG won't work properly. If you want to practice in attuned, turn off this mod in the game settings.
- The mod affects bosses of health. Needless to say, it shouldn't be used with other modded boss. If you do want to, turn this mod off in the game settings.
- If you find any bugs, you can message me on discord at Mulhima#2695

## Credits
- Thank you to everyone in #modding-development for helping me make this mod and also for having open source code for me to read. This mod was heavily influcenced by the mods Pale Prince by fifty-six, Mantis Gods by fifty-six and Buzzbo by thegodfriend.
